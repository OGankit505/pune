    <h1>Traditional Clothing of Pune</h1>

    <h2>Men's Attire</h2>
    <p>Men in Pune traditionally wear a dhoti paired with a kurta and a pheta (traditional turban). The dhoti is a piece of unstitched cloth wrapped around the waist and is a common lower garment in Maharashtra. The kurta is a loose-fitting shirt with a straight cut. The pheta is a distinctive turban that symbolizes honor and respect.</p>

    <h2>Women's Attire</h2>
    <p>Women in Pune traditionally wear a saree. The Maharashtrian style of draping a saree is known as the Nauvari saree. It involves tucking the saree at the back and draping it in a special way to form nine yards. Women also wear a choli (blouse) and adorn themselves with traditional jewelry like a nath (nose ring), kolhapuri saaj necklace, and green and red bangles.</p>
